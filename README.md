# CubePostprocessor

Just a post processor make life easier with Cube 2 from 3DSystems.

Support KISSlicer 1.5b and Cura 1.5.

In early stages, does not do much yet.

With KISS, it allows for solid and infill extrusion amount tuning.
With Cura it basically just cleans the file for printing, no extra options yet.
